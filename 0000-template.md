# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?
Consider listing any specific Goals and Non-Goals as sub-sections.

# Guide-level Explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the API and you were teaching it to another developer. That generally means:

* Introducing new named concepts.
* Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
* If applicable, provide sample error messages.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

* Its interaction with other features is clear.
* It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
* Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature already exist in a player?
- Has this feature been discussed in a blog post, paper, or presentation?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other players, and provide readers of your proposal with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the proposal process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this proposal that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this proposal?
